// Definition
@definition"Homogeneous"
"A substance can be defined as homogeneous if it contains only one kind of 
particles. Homogeneous is Latin for 'the same kind'."

@definition"Heterogeneous"
"A substance can be defined as heterogeneous if it contains multiple kinds of 
particles. Opposite of homogeneous."

@qa "Describe the structure of a tooth." 
"{{@img tooth structure.png}}"
"The tooth has two anatomical parts - **crown** and **root**.  

1. **Crown** - The part of a tooth which is above the gums and is visible in 
   the mouth.
2. **Root** - The part of the teeth embedded in the jaw. It anchors the tooth 
   in its bony socket and is not usually visible. The root is covered by a layer 
   of tough, yellowish, bone-like tissue called the **cementum**

In addition the structure of the tooth is divided into the following parts:

1. The core of the teeth consisting of soft tissues containing blood 
    vessels and nerve supply, called **pulp**
2. A layer of bone-like material surrounding the pulp cavity called 
   **dentine**
3. Hard covering on the dentine called **Enamel**
